# Examples
Here you will find an example of both iOS and Android implementations of `react-native-spotlight-tour`.

## Running the examples

You should be located in the `/example` directory.

For running the iOS example, you need to access the directory `/ios` and use:
```
pod install
```
This will install the necessary dependencies for the project.

Then, back in the `/example` directory use:
```
yarn ios
```

For running the Android example, use:
```
yarn android
```

Finally, to start the react server you could use: 
```
yarn start
```
